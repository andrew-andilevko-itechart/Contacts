# React Native Application for [GlossGenius Engineering team](https://glossgenius.recruitee.com/)

## Retrospective

**1. What went well?**

- Share a common `<Form />` component for CreateContact and EditContact screens.
- A similar design for both platform without noticeable differences
- Offline mode

**2. What didnâ€™t go well?**

2.1. On condition of tight deadlines, I had to use `redux-persist`(it is not really good way to serialize a redux
store and storage).

2.2. Not enough strong test and types coverage

**3. If you had more time to work on this**

I would add support dark theme (iOS, Android), also integrate i18n and improve code style.
